            guest: 'Marc Andreessen',
            conversationSummary: 'Marc opens by challenging the "apps are dead" narrative, arguing infrastructure plays are actually enabling a new class of applications we couldn\'t build before. Chamath pushes back hard, pointing to Jasper\'s 90% revenue decline as proof of commoditization. The debate gets heated when Friedberg brings up unit economics - Marc insists the math works at scale while Sacks questions whether any AI app has defensible moats. They find common ground on vertical AI with proprietary data being the only sustainable play. The conversation shifts when Marc reveals a16z is going all-in on infrastructure precisely because it enables their portfolio companies to build differentiated products cheaper.',

            guest: 'Sarah Tavel',
            conversationSummary: 'Sarah doesn\'t sugarcoat it - "This is the hardest Series A environment I\'ve seen in 15 years." Harry probes on specific metrics, and Sarah reveals Benchmark\'s new internal bar has quietly moved from $1M to $3M ARR. The conversation turns fascinating when she shares how even their own portfolio companies are struggling to hit these numbers. Sarah admits they\'re now recommending 24-month runways as standard, up from 18. When Harry asks about AI companies, she\'s blunt: "Unless you\'re infrastructure, you need $5M minimum - the multiples just don\'t work otherwise."

Nicole explains the three-year journey to convince the board, including heated debates about venture\'s J-curve and liquidity issues. The turning point came when she presented data showing their venture portfolio outperformed public markets by 500bps over 20 years. Ted challenges her on concentration risk, but Nicole stands firm: "We\'d rather back 10 exceptional specialist funds than 50 generalists." The conversation gets tactical when she reveals they now require GPs to show clear DPI paths - no more "patient capital" narratives. She specifically calls out sector-focused funds as outperformers, citing Lux (deep tech) and Foresite (healthcare) as models.',

            guest: 'Jensen Huang, Roelof Botha',
            conversationSummary: 'Ben and David start by asking Jensen the trillion-dollar question: "Is this sustainable?" Jensen\'s response is emphatic - "We\'re in inning two of a nine-inning game." Roelof jumps in with Sequoia\'s data showing every successful AI company spending 4x on infrastructure versus revenue. The conversation heats up when they debate the democratization thesis - Jensen argues costs will drop 90% annually, but Roelof counters that demand is growing even faster. The real insight comes when Jensen breaks down NVIDIA\'s roadmap: "Every company will need their own AI infrastructure like they needed websites in 1995." David connects the dots to the VC ecosystem, noting how every fund is now hiring ML engineers just to evaluate deals.',

            conversationSummary: 'Palmer doesn\'t hold back - "Silicon Valley\'s ESG obsession left a trillion dollars on the table." Tim pushes on the ethics, but Palmer reframes brilliantly: "Democracies need technological superiority to survive." The conversation turns when Palmer reveals Anduril\'s valuation journey from "uninvestable" to $14B in five years. He shares how Peter Thiel was the only major VC who initially got it, while others worried about "reputational risk." The money quote comes midway: "We\'re replacing soldiers with software - that\'s more humane, not less." Tim asks about competition, and Palmer laughs: "The defense primes are bringing tanks to a drone fight." He predicts 50% of defense spending will shift to autonomous systems within a decade.',

The hosts are skeptical - Adam asks about accuracy concerns. Thomas shares internal data: developers using Copilot ship 55% more code with 40% fewer bugs. The conversation pivots when they discuss Cursor\'s $2.5B valuation. Thomas is surprisingly gracious: "Competition validates the market - there\'s room for multiple winners." The discussion gets spicy when they debate AI replacing developers. Thomas firmly disagrees: "We\'re augmenting, not replacing. The demand for software is infinite."

Ruth Porat provides the strategic buyer perspective, revealing Google has $100B earmarked for acquisitions through 2026. The conversation gets interesting when Dan Dees shares actual data - strategic acquirers are paying 40-60% premiums because "they\'re buying time, not technology." Frank drops a bombshell: "Every founder should be building relationships with potential acquirers from day one." Ruth agrees, adding that Google now has a team dedicated to tracking Series A companies. The panel consensus: M&A is the new IPO, and it\'s not temporary.',

Josh reveals Thrive\'s thesis: they\'re betting on 20-30 vertical AI winners across industries. The group debates which verticals are next.
