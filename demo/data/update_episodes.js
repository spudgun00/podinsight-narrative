Ben pushes on adoption rates, and Nat shares exclusive data - 75% of Fortune 500 developers already use AI daily. The conversation pivots when discussing Cursor's $2.5B valuation. Nat sees it validating the market: 'There's room for 10 billion-dollar companies in AI dev tools.' He reveals the real opportunity isn't in coding assistance but in AI handling entire development workflows - from requirements to deployment.",
