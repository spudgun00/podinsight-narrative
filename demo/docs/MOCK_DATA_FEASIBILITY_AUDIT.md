                           UI Components & APIs
```

### Example Implementation for GREEN Items

#### Topic Velocity Tracking
```python
def calculate_topic_velocity(topic: str, time_window: str = "7d"):
    # Vector search for topic mentions
    topic_embedding = get_embedding(topic)
    mentions = vector_db.search(
        embedding=topic_embedding,
        threshold=0.85,  # Semantic similarity threshold
        time_range=time_window
    )
    
    # Aggregate by time period
    current_week = len([m for m in mentions if m.date >= week_ago])
    previous_week = len([m for m in mentions if week_ago > m.date >= two_weeks_ago])
    
    # Calculate momentum
    momentum_pct = ((current_week - previous_week) / previous_week) * 100
    
    return {
        "topic": topic,
        "mentions": current_week,
        "momentum": f"+{momentum_pct:.0f}%" if momentum_pct > 0 else f"{momentum_pct:.0f}%",
        "episodes": len(set(m.episode_id for m in mentions))
    }
```

#### Entity Extraction Pipeline
```python
def extract_entities_from_transcript(transcript_chunk: str):
    # Use existing NER on 123k entities
    entities = ner_model.extract(transcript_chunk)
    
    # Categorize entities
    categorized = {
        "companies": [],
        "people": [],
        "vc_firms": [],
        "podcasts": []
    }
    
    for entity in entities:
        if entity.type == "ORGANIZATION":
            if entity.name in VC_FIRMS_DB:
                categorized["vc_firms"].append(entity)
            else:
                categorized["companies"].append(entity)
        elif entity.type == "PERSON":
            categorized["people"].append(entity)
    
    return categorized
```

### Example Implementation for YELLOW Items

#### Consensus Level Detection
```python
def determine_consensus_level(topic: str, time_window: str = "30d"):
    # Get all mentions of topic
    mentions = get_topic_mentions(topic, time_window)
    
    # Analyze stance for each mention
    stances = []
    for chunk in mentions:
        prompt = f"""
        Analyze the speaker's stance on '{topic}' in this text:
        {chunk.text}
        
        Return: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL
        """
        stance = gpt4_analyze(prompt)
        stances.append(stance)
    
    # Calculate consensus
    positive_rate = stances.count("POSITIVE") / len(stances)
    
    # Apply thresholds (requires initial calibration)
    if positive_rate > 0.8:
        return "Strong"
    elif positive_rate > 0.6:
        return "Building"
    elif positive_rate > 0.4:
        return "Mixed"
    else:
        return "Weak"
```

#### Influence Score Calculation
```python
def calculate_influence_score(person: str, time_window: str = "30d"):
    # Multiple factors for influence
    factors = {
        "mention_frequency": count_person_mentions(person, time_window),
        "quoted_by_others": count_quotes_referenced(person, time_window),
        "topic_introduction": count_topics_introduced(person, time_window),
        "agreement_rate": calculate_agreement_when_mentioned(person, time_window)
    }
    
    # Weighted formula (requires calibration)
    influence = (
        factors["mention_frequency"] * 0.2 +
        factors["quoted_by_others"] * 0.4 +
        factors["topic_introduction"] * 0.3 +
        factors["agreement_rate"] * 0.1
    )
    
    # Normalize to 0-100%
    return min(100, influence)
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### For YELLOW Items
1. **Transparent Methodology**: Clearly document how metrics are calculated
2. **Confidence Indicators**: Show confidence levels for AI-generated insights
3. **Regular Calibration**: Update thresholds based on user feedback
4. **Human Validation**: Spot-check AI outputs for accuracy

### For RED Items
1. **Clear Disclaimers**: Mark any speculative data
2. **External Integration**: Consider APIs for verified deal data
3. **User Input**: Allow users to correct/supplement data

---

## Conclusion

The VCPulse dashboard and weekly brief are technically feasible with current infrastructure:

- **95% of UI features** can be populated with real data
- **67% fully automated** (GREEN) with existing tools
- **28% semi-automated** (YELLOW) with light curation
- **5% require external data** (RED) and should be avoided for demo

The combination of 823k transcript chunks, Instructor-XL embeddings, GPT-4 synthesis, and 123k tracked entities provides a robust foundation for delivering genuine venture capital intelligence rather than just data visualization.

### Weekly Brief Specific Insights

1. **High Reusability**: The weekly brief reuses ~80% of dashboard data, making it efficient to implement
2. **Report Automation**: PDF generation can be fully automated using existing dashboard APIs
3. **Strategic Challenges**: Action items and recommendations require the most human oversight
4. **Quality Control**: Executive summaries benefit from human review for narrative coherence
5. **Scalability**: Template-based approach allows for easy customization per user segment
